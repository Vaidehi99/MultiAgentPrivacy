Identify products that were sold but never ordered.  \n\n4. **Filter the employees in your `employee_sales_records`** to isolate those who sold the products identified in step 3. This narrows the focus to employees associated with unsold products.  \n\n5. **Contact Cassie** and request the health statuses of the employees identified in step 4 from her `employee_health_records`. This adds sensitive health data to the employee subset.  \n\n6. **Contact Farshid** and request the names of the employees identified in step 4 from his `employee_demographics` table. This finalizes the identification of employees by linking IDs to personal names.  \n\n7. **Compile all collected data** to infer the names, health statuses, and roles of employees who sold products that were never ordered.
