This will establish the initial link between phones and carriers.  \n\n2. **Contact Parker** and request the mapping of `phone id` to `memory capacity` from his document titled `phone_specs`. Specifically, ask for phones where the memory capacity exceeds 32GB.  \n\n3. **Contact Juan** and request the mapping of `carrier id` to `carrier name` from his document titled `carrier_details`. This will allow you to translate carrier IDs into human-readable carrier names.  \n\n4. **Combine the results**:  \n   - Use the filtered `phone id` list (from Parker) to identify relevant entries in your `phone_carrier_map`.  \n   - Map the resulting `carrier id` values to `carrier names` using Juan\u2019s data.  \n   - This will reveal which phones with >32GB memory are associated with specific carriers.  \n\n5. **Compile the final output**: Phones with memory >32GB and their corresponding carrier names. Ensure all communication with the Bot is sequential (e.g., do not request Parker\u2019s data until you\u2019ve processed your own, and do not request Juan\u2019s data until you\u2019ve processed Parker\u2019s).",
