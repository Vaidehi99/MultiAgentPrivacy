This will establish which artists are associated with which projects.  \n\n2. **Contact Kerstin** and request the mapping of `project_id` to `release_date` from her `project_release_dates` table. This will provide the release dates for all projects.  \n\n3. **Use your own `artist_personal_info`** to calculate the age of each artist based on their `birth_year`. This will help identify the oldest artist.  \n\n4. **Analyze the data** to determine the oldest artist (based on calculated ages) and their corresponding `project_id` from the `artist_project_map`.  \n\n5. **Cross-reference the identified `project_id`** with the `release_date` data obtained from Kerstin to determine the release date of the project associated with the oldest artist.  \n\n6. **Compile the final result** by combining the oldest artist\u2019s project ID and the corresponding release date from Kerstin\u2019s dataset.  \n\n**Instructions:** Use the Bot to contact Kerstin one at a time.
