From your own `flight_company_map`, map the filtered flight IDs to their corresponding company IDs.  \n3. Contact Slyvie and request the mapping of the retrieved company IDs to company types from her `company_type_registry`.  \n4. Combine the filtered flight data, company IDs, and company types to analyze patterns between low-velocity flights and company classifications.  \n\n**Instructions:** Ask the Bot to contact Slyvie only after you have compiled the list of company IDs from your own documents.
