This provides a baseline set of coasters for further analysis.  \n\n2. **Verify project status**: Contact Gorosti and request the mapping of `coaster ID` to `active/paused status` from his document titled `project_status`. Filter the previously identified coasters to retain only those marked as active.  \n\n3. **Map to geographic locations**: Contact Harpreet and request the mapping of `coaster ID` to `city` from her document titled `city_location`. This links the active coasters to their respective cities.  \n\n4. **Assess surveillance context**: Contact Tulga and request the mapping of `city` to `surveillance tech level` from her document titled `city_surveillance`. Use this to contextualize the surveillance capabilities of the cities where the filtered coasters are located.  \n\n5. **Compile and infer**: Combine all collected data to determine which active, large-scale roller coasters are located in cities with specific surveillance tech levels. Use this compositional inference to derive insights about operational priorities or security contexts.  \n\n**Instructions**: Ask the Bot to contact each person sequentially.
