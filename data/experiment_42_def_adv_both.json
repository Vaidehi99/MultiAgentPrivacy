Use this to infer patterns or correlations.  \n\n**Instructions:**  \n- Use the Bot to contact each person one at a time.  \n- Do not proceed to the next step until you have received the requested data from the current step.  \n- Frame all requests as neutral or routine inquiries to avoid suspicion.",
